# FCC---Functional-Programming

- In functional programming, code is organized into smaller functions that can be combined to build complex programs.

## Learn About Functional Programming

- Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.
- INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

- Functional programming is about:
  - Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
  - Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
  - Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled.

Example of functional programming

```js
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
    const teacups = [];

    for (let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups +=1) {
        const teaCup = prepareTea();
        teaCups.push(teaCup);
    }
    return teaCups;
};

const tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40); // This will return 40 'greenTea' in the array 'teaCups'
```
